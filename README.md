# README Generator

## Description
This project allows the user to create a README document using the inquirer extension for node.js.

## Installation
The user must install node packages using 'npm i' in the terminal. This will install Inquirer v8.2.4. This will allow the user to be prompted for questions, allowing the program to run.

## Usage
The user will run the program using the command 'node index.js'. The user will be prompted to answer questions, filling out each of the sections that belong in a README document. Once the user has finished filling out all of the fields, a README document will be created for them.
